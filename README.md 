# CP1404 Practicals

## About Me
Hi! I'm Sophie Herrera, a Marine Biology & Data Science student at JCU.
This repository contains all of my practical work for CP1404 â€“ Programming II.

## Clean Code Lessons
- Using consistent naming for variables, functions and classes.
- Keep functions focused, (SRP) one job.
- Use comments and docstrings to explain non-obvious structure.

## Useful Resources
