# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have made an effort to start working on practicals earlier and not leave everything to the last minute.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I want to ask for help when I get stuck instead of trying it on my own for too long and coming to a wrong solution/ conclusion.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I take my time to watch the lectures and follow along with demos.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop rushing, do proper testing and make sure all parts of my program behave as expected. I also want to avoid to get things done " as fast as possible" and take more time to really understand every step.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Maybe it would help to have more examples of common mistakes or misunderstandings at the end of lectures or pracs.
