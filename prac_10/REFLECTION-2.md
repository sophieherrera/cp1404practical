# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimates are not very accurate, i used to over and underestimate how long a project would take. 

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I used to underestimate harder tasks and overestimate smaller tasks. Now i tend to underestimate tasks, not realizing their complexity at first. 

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

To carefully read instructions and reflect on my abilities, before estimating a time for completion.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

getting feedback on your code is important to improve and is very valuable. It helps seeing it from another students perspective, instead of a lecturer because we might've had similar struggles or issues with the assignment.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

It gave me ideas how i could improve my own code, either by seeing good practice and adding that to my next practical or realizing i had similar issues in my code without realizing.
I also recognized that i know more about coding than i thought i did. 



Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[](https://github.com/jd115406/cp1404practicals/pull/2#event-18715451838)

### Explanation

In this review i provided specific feedback on naming conventions and also suggested structural improvements. I gave a well rounded final comment.

### Good Code Review 2

[](https://github.com/JDMjcu/CP1404practicals/pull/4#discussion_r2250289442)

### Explanation

In this review i identified possible issues in the code and gave alternative options and approaches. 

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would not have a practical 10, since assignment 2 is due that week and students might benefit more if they could invest more time studying for the actual exam. Especially because the exam is in a respondus/ LearnJCU style, which means students have to adapt the way they write code and practice quite a bit.. 
Or say Prac 10 is a practice exam or something along the lines of that. 

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I committed regularly and clearly and I tried to implement feedback to the best of my abilities.
